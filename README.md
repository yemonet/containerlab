# Containerlab: yemo
my containerlab in this repo

A collection of reproducible network labs built with [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/).
This repository is intended for quick protocol validation, topology experiments, and network automation practice.

## What you get

- Repeatable lab deployments with simple commands (`deploy`, `destroy`)
- Topology-as-code (`*.clab.yml`) you can version-control and share
- Easy visualization via `containerlab graph`
- Works great with VS Code Remote (WSL/SSH) for a smooth lab workflow
